class DyingWebSocketClientFactory(WebSocketClientFactory):
	"""
	Implements a light wrapper on autobahn's WebSocketClientFactory in order to
	stop the Twisted reactor on a connection failure or other connection loss.

	This has the effect of making the bot quit when it loses connection,
	allowing it to be restarted.

	The "better" way is to handle the disconnect and then initiate a new RTM
	session on a connection loss, but it also means rewriting lots of the
	metadata.

	Without this alternate factory, when the connection to the Slack RTM service
	is lost, the reactor will keep running, effectively making your bot "hang".

	This can be used with the following code::

		conn = connect(
			slack_api_token,
			protocol=MySlackbotProtocol,
			factory=DyingWebSocketClientFactory
		)
